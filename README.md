# World_Weather_Analysis
PlanMyTrip is a top travel company that specializes in internet related services in the Hotel and Loding Industry.
Jack,head of User Interface team wants us to collect weather data for random cities and suggest the hotels for the customers based on their weather preference.

## Overview of Analysis
Gathering data from an API is more practical and efficient than gathering data directly from the web.When an API request is made,the data is returned in various formats.The most popular one is JSON format.It stores data as key value pair so it is easy to retrieve the data.In order to generate latitudes and longitudes,Pandas `random()` function is used,To collect weather data from cities,CitiPy Module has been used.Some of the statistical analysis has been peformed based on the latitude and various weather parameters and linear regression was used.

## Resources Used
*DataSources*: CitiPy Module,APIs,JSON Traversals,Python requests,SciPy<br>
*Software used*: Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5.<br> 
*Libraries*: Panda,Matplotlib <br>
*Language*: Python 3.9.7. 
*Generated CSV Files*:  [Weather_Database.csv](https://github.com/fathi129/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/master/Weather_Database/WeatherPy_Database.csv), [WeatherPy_vacation.csv](https://github.com/fathi129/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/master/Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_vacation.csv)

## Purpose of Analysis
The Purpose of this analysis is to retrieve the data from the website through an API call,store the data,plot the graph using matplotlib and google maps and perform various statistical analysis.Based upon the collected data,we need to suggest the cities for the user weather preference and then we need to suggest the hotels and travel route for the cities.

## Weather Database
A random set of 2000 latitudes and longitudes are generated using Pandas `random()` function.For the generated coordinates,the nearest city is found using the Python's CitiPy module.The cities list is created.For the generated cities we need to collect the weather information,to do this we use OpenWeatherMap API.An API request is performed and the response is retrieved as JSON.The required weather parameters were retrieved and stored as Data Frame.The data frame is exported as CSV file.<br>
- Latitude and Longitude
- Percent Humidity
- Maximum Temperature
- Percent Cloudiness
- Wind Speed
- Country,City,Weather Description<br>

## Vacation Search
The generated weather database CSV file is read, Based on travelerâ€™s weather preferences,they can identify travel destinations and nearby hotels. Using Googles Places API,the hotel are retrieved for the nearest cities.The map showcases destinations on a marker layer map using pop-up markers.<br>

The heat disspipating map is also generated by adding the heat layer and including the temperature in it.<br>

## Vacation Itinerary
From the map,the user has chosen 4 cities for the vacation itinerary which has temperature in between 75 and 90 and they are nearby.The cities are
Ken Caryl,Ridgecrest,Port Hueneme,Show Low.Using the Google Directions API,a travel itinerary is created,that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customers possible travel destinations.

Then a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city in the itinerary is created.

## Statistical Analysis
Some of the statistical Analysis were also performed based on the latitude and different weather parameters and Scatter plots were plotted.Based on the latitude we can say how the weather changes in various places.

The correlation between the two variables are determined using linear regression lines and equations.Based on the generated r-values,we can say how the temperature changes when we approach to the equator and we move further away.
